Tableau Prep work for machine learning on the Titanic dataset

This repo contains all the files and code to create a Tableau Prep flow that uses R.

# Introduction

As a Tableau Prep user, I have noticed that R lacked some good case with Tableau Prep. To solve this issue, I created a workflow that combines both. The goal of the workflow was to predict survival of a subset of the passenger of the Titanic.

# Data
The data has been sourced from the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster tutorial competition.

# Tableau Prep
This flow has been made on Tableau Prep 2019.4.2

# R / Rserve
I used R version 3.6.2 with the following packages:
* base 3.6.2
* stats 3.6.2
* utils 3.6.2
* stringr 1.4.0
* ranger 0.11.2
* Metrics 0.1.4
* Rserve 1.7-3.1

I used Rstudio version 1.5.2019 to write the code.
